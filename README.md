## About

An android wallpaper app made using java. This app uses the Pexels API to fetch all the wallpapers.
I have used two recycler view to display the fecthed wallpapers. The first is horizontal view where users can select a specific wallpaper category and the second is a staggered view where all the wallpaper is displayed. users can also search for wallpaper using the search bar and the results is shown through the API. Users can also set a specific wallpaper as their background.
